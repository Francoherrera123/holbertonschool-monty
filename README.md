## Monty Bytecode Interpreter
This is a Monty bytecode interpreter developed in C. Monty is a simple, high-level programming language that is intended to be used as a scripting language.

# Requirements
## General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
You allowed to use a maximum of one global variable
No more than 5 functions per file
You are allowed to use the C standard library
The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called monty.h
Donâ€™t forget to push your header file
All your header files should be include guarded
You are expected to do the tasks in the order shown in the project

## Compilation & Output
Your code will be compiled this way:
```$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o monty```
Any output must be printed on stdout
Any error message must be printed on stderr

## Supported operations
The interpreter supports the following operations:

- push	Pushes an element to the stack
- pall	Prints all elements in the stack
- pint	Prints the value at the top of the stack
- pop	Removes the top element from the stack
- swap	Swaps the top two elements in the stack
- add	Adds the top two elements in the stack
- nop	Does nothing

# Functions

- get_opcode_function: Matches opcodes with their respective functions.
- _push: Pushes an element to the stack.
- _pall: Prints all elements in the stack.
- _pint: Prints the value at the top of the stack.
- _pop: Removes the top element from the stack.
- _swap: Swaps the top two elements in the stack.
- _add: Adds the top two elements in the stack.
